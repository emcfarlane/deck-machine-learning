A vector is a matrix with one column and many rows:
$$$
\begin{bmatrix}
           x_{1} \\
           x_{2} \\
           \vdots \\
           x_{m}
         \end{bmatrix}

### Notation and terms:
- $A_{ij}$ refers to the element in the ith row and jth column of matrix A.
- A vector with 'n' rows is referred to as an 'n'-dimensional vector.
- $v_{i}$ refers to the element in the ith row of the vector.
- "Scalar" means that an object is a single value, not a vector or matrix.
- $\mathbb{R}$ refers to the set of scalar real numbers.
- $\mathbb{R}^n$ refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.
